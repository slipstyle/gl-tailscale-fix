# Toggle Tailscale (GL native) + gl-tailscale-fix Kill Switch and related preferences via
# the physical side switch on supported GL.iNet routers (Beryl AX, Slate AX, etc.).
#
# Leak protection: at the start of each "on" flip, the script installs a temporary
# blackhole at ip-rule priority 5260 (above Tailscale's exit-node routing at 5270 and
# the plugin's normal kill switch at 5280). This blocks all LAN/guest forwarding for
# the duration of the transition — between competing-VPN teardown and Tailscale being
# fully up — eliminating the IP-leak window that would otherwise exist. The lockdown
# is released only after the plugin's 5280 KS is confirmed in place. On abnormal exit,
# the lockdown stays (fail-secure: LAN blackout instead of leak). The "off" path also
# cleans up any lingering lockdown rules from an interrupted prior "on".
#
# Prerequisites — verify all of these BEFORE deploying this script:
#   1. gl-tailscale-fix v1.0.9 or later installed on the router.
#   2. Tailscale enabled in the GL admin UI at least once and bound to your Tailscale
#      account ("Bind Account" set).
#   3. A Custom Exit Node selected at least once in the GL UI (so an exit node IP is
#      stored in tailscale.settings.exit_node_ip — the script reuses GL's most recent
#      selection on each "on" flip).
#   4. Exit node(s) approved in the Tailscale admin console at
#      https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines (Edit route settings → Use as exit node).
#   5. If LAN_ENABLED=true (the default): this router's LAN subnet route also approved
#      in the Tailscale admin console.
#   6. Any WireGuard, OpenVPN, or Tor client tunnel managed via the GL admin UI (Apps
#      menu) should be disabled before configuring the slider. Their policy routing at
#      priority 6000 wins against Tailscale's exit-node routing at priority 5270, so
#      Tailscale traffic wouldn't actually flow through the exit node. The script also
#      defensively disables WG/OVPN/Tor on each "on" flip — but only as a backup for
#      the case where the slider was previously bound to one of those functions and is
#      being rebound to Tailscale. It is not a substitute for the proper GUI-side disable.
#   7. End-to-end tested in the GL UI before relying on the slider — enable Tailscale,
#      select the exit node, confirm your LAN clients route through it and the kill
#      switch engages.
#
# Firmware compatibility:
#   - Verified on firmware 4.8.x (and 4.9.0 by inference — plugin works on both).
#   - Designed to work on pre-4.8 firmware (4.6.x, 4.7.x — SlateAX, Brume 2, Mudi, etc.).
#     The 5260 lockdown is firmware-agnostic and overlays cleanly on GL's pre-4.8
#     vpnpolicy.global.kill_switch mechanism. Pre-4.8 lab verification is pending — if
#     you encounter the slider on pre-4.8 producing a persistent LAN blackout after
#     Tailscale comes up, file an issue with the firmware version + router model.
#
# Install on the router:
#   wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RemoteToHome-io/gl-tailscale-fix/main/examples/gl-switch.d/tailscale.sh -O /etc/gl-switch.d/tailscale.sh
#   chmod +x /etc/gl-switch.d/tailscale.sh
#
# Bind the physical slider to this script. The GL admin UI dropdown for Toggle Button
# Settings does NOT list Tailscale as an option, so this must be done via UCI:
#   uci set switch-button.@main[0].func='tailscale'
#   uci commit switch-button
#
# IMPORTANT: after the UCI binding, DO NOT open System → Toggle Button Settings in the
# GL admin UI. That page only knows about its hardcoded function list, so it will display
# "No Function" (or a stale prior selection) and clicking Apply will overwrite the UCI
# binding with whatever the GUI displays. To unbind cleanly, run:
#   uci set switch-button.@main[0].func='' && uci commit switch-button
#
# Then edit the Configuration block below to your preferred posture. Every "on" flip
# applies that posture in full, so a single edit here locks in your setup across switch
# toggles.
#
# Exit-node handling is special: by default the script reuses GL's most recently selected
# exit node (so changing the selection in the GL UI sticks across toggles). DEFAULT_EXIT_NODE_IP
# is used only as a fallback on first run, when nothing has been selected yet.
#
# By default this script treats slider "on" as "enable Tailscale + apply posture" and
# slider "off" as "disable everything." If you prefer the inverted convention (resting
# position is "off" with Tailscale active), swap the action names in the if/elif branches.
#
# To verify which physical slider position your router reports as "on", SSH in and run:
#   . /lib/functions/gl_util.sh; get_switch_button_status
# It prints the literal string "on" or "off". Flip the slider, run again, compare. GL
# handles per-model GPIO polarity quirks inside that function, so the semantic is
# portable across hardware.
#
# Released under the same terms as gl-tailscale-fix (GPL-3.0).
