# Toggle Tailscale (GL native) + gl-tailscale-fix Kill Switch and related preferences together via the physical side switch on supported GL.iNet routers (Beryl AX, Slate AX, etc.).
#
# Prerequisites — verify all of these BEFORE deploying this script:
#   1. gl-tailscale-fix v1.0.9 or later installed on the router.
#   2. Tailscale enabled in the GL admin UI at least once and bound to your Tailscale account ("Bind Account" set).
#   3. A Custom Exit Node selected at least once in the GL UI (so an exit node IP is stored in tailscale.settings.exit_node_ip — the script reuses GL's most recent selection on each "on" flip).
#   4. Exit node(s) approved in the Tailscale admin console at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines (Edit route settings → Use as exit node).
#   5. If LAN_ENABLED=true (the default): this router's LAN subnet route also approved in the Tailscale admin console.
#   6. End-to-end tested in the GL UI before relying on the slider — enable Tailscale, select the exit node, confirm your LAN clients route through it and the kill switch engages.
#
# Install on the router:
#   wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RemoteToHome-io/gl-tailscale-fix/main/examples/gl-switch.d/Tailscale.sh -O /etc/gl-switch.d/Tailscale.sh
#   chmod +x /etc/gl-switch.d/Tailscale.sh
#
# Then edit the Configuration block below to your preferred posture. Every "on" flip applies that posture in full, so a single edit here locks in your setup across switch toggles.
#
# Exit-node handling is special: by default the script reuses GL's most recently selected exit node (so changing the selection in the GL UI sticks across toggles). DEFAULT_EXIT_NODE_IP is used only as a fallback on first run, when nothing has been selected yet.
#
# By default this script treats slider "on" as "enable Tailscale + apply posture" and slider "off" as "disable everything." If you prefer the inverted convention (resting position is "off" with Tailscale active), swap the action names in the if/elif branches below.
#
# Released under the same terms as gl-tailscale-fix (GPL-3.0).

# --- Configuration ---
DEFAULT_EXIT_NODE_IP="XX.XX.XX.XX"   # Fallback only — used on first run when GL has no exit node selected in UCI

# GL native settings
LAN_ENABLED=true                      # Allow Remote Access LAN — required for tailnet peers to reach LAN devices behind this router; subnet route must also be approved in the TS admin console
WAN_ENABLED=false                     # Allow Remote Access WAN — only needed when advertising this router as an exit node

# gl-tailscale-fix preferences — applied on every "on" because the plugin's watchdog tears these down to 0 when Tailscale is disabled.
KILL_SWITCH=true                      # Engage kill switch on enable
ROUTE_GUEST=false                     # Route guest network through Tailscale
ADVERTISE_EXIT_NODE=false             # Advertise this router as an exit node
TAILSCALE_SSH=false                   # Enable Tailscale's ACL-based SSH

# --- Logic ---

if [ "$action" = "on" ]; then
    # Reuse GL's most recently selected exit node IP; fall back to default only when GL has nothing set (first run or after a manual clear).
    exit_node_ip=$(uci -q get tailscale.settings.exit_node_ip)
    [ -z "$exit_node_ip" ] && exit_node_ip="$DEFAULT_EXIT_NODE_IP"

    # Enable Tailscale via GL's RPC, passing the resolved exit node IP.

elif [ "$action" = "off" ]; then
    # Disable Tailscale via UCI directly, bypassing GL's RPC. This preserves tailscale.settings.exit_node_ip so the next "on" flip reconnects to the same node — calling GL's set_config would clear it. The gl-tailscale-fix watchdog detects the enabled=0 transition and tears down the kill switch routing rules within ~5 seconds.
